Requirements
------------

- Kanboard >= 1.0.33
- PHP 5.6 or >= 7.0.0

Installation
------------

You have the choice between 2 methods:

1. Download the zip file and decompress everything under the directory `plugins/Imap`
2. Clone this repository into the folder `plugins/Imap`

Finally add a crontab with this line:

	* * * * *  /path/to/kanboard/plugins/Imap/cron.php /path/to/kanboad/data/db.sqlite

Configuration
-------------

Go to Kanboard -> Settings -> Integrations
Go to Kanboard -> Project -> Menu -> Settings -> Edit project and add an Identifier

Testing
-------

You can send an email with the format _happykanboard+PROJECTIDENTIFIER@riseup.net_. The email subject will become the task title, and the email body that will become the task content.

You can also send an email with this format in subject: _Finish Duke Nukem Forever 2 \<PROJECTIDENTIFIER\> please!_ The task title will be "Finish Duke Nukem Forever 2 please!", and details in the email body that will be the task content.

If automatic confirmation emails are enabled, you should receive confirmation that the task was created. You can reply to the confirmation email to add comments to the task.
